        QUESTION 2

    <h1>
        Paragraph on equality
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Why is the world not equal?
    </h2>
    <p class="ad">
        Equality means "the state of being equal." It's one of the ideals a democratic society, and so the fight to
        attain different kinds of equality, like racial equality, gender equality, or equality of opportunity between
        rich and poor, is often associated with progress toward that ideal of everyone being truly equal.
    </p>
    <p class="sd">
        From my point of view everyone is equal. Whether they are male or female, rich or poor, healthy or disabled,
        Black or white, upper class or lowerclass, and many more. why are people treating each other differently when
        you all have one thing in common, that you are a human.
